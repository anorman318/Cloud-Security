# Cloud-Security
A network diagram of the cloud infrastructure I created in a simulated environment  

**Cloud Recap**  

Over the last week, you created a highly available web server for XCorp's Red Team to use for testing and training. Now, your lead cloud administrator has asked for a diagram of the Network that you created to keep for documentation and company records.  

Diagram should include:  
* A total of two VMs running DVWA
* Both VMS receiving traffic from your load balancer
* Azure resource group
* Virtual network with IP address range
* Subnet range
* Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
* Security group blocking traffic
* Where Docker and Ansible are deployed
